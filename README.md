# PredictingDiabetes

  Diabetes effects 34.2 million people in the US, according to the CDC. Diabetes is a disease that causes a person's body to ineffectively use insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar. The ineffective use of insulin can lead to many deadly health complications such as heart attacks, stroke, vision loss and much more. Did you know that 1 in 5 people are unaware that they have diabetes? Because of this, it is very important to predict the onset of diabetes. This project consisted of a logistic regression with diabetes as the binary response variable. The explanatory variables include one’s medical attributes, such as blood pressure, glucose levels, BMI, etc. 
  
  I used the Pima Indians dataset that was found on Kaggle from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. This dataset consists of 768 female patients who are at least 21 years old. It includes an “Outcome” variable, whether the patient had diabetes or did not have diabetes.
  
  #### This project was done in R for Fall Analytics Day 2021 at Kennesaw State University.
